## About this guide

This guide is aimed at both developers working on Rust programs for end-users and libraries developers.

It focuses on currently available tooling for the Rust ecosystem, but also mentions more
general advice or tooling. It has a hands-on focus and tries to provide actionnable items
whenever possible. 
It will also mention the current limitations and missing parts.
It builds upon existing resources, like [llogiq's blog post](https://blog.logrocket.com/comparing-rust-supply-chain-safety-tools/).
